Title: Measuring content and relational of (political) debates
Author: Emmanuel Rousseaux and Marion Deville
Maintainer: Emmanuel Rousseaux <emmanuel.rousseaux@unige.ch>
Description: Several dimensions are in play during a debate. This is especially
    the case for political debates. This package provides tools for measuring
    both the content and the relational dynamics of debates. For measuring
    content we suggest to use a thematic coding based on a dictionary. From
    this dictionary, the list of the actors of the debate, and the memorials in
    PDF files, the package can help you to count occurences of dictionnary
    items in each actor speechs. The relational is measured by count approval,
    disapproval and neutral references between actors. Using the spnet package
    as a back-end for the visualization, the user can display both the content
    and the relational aspects of the debate on the assembly map. See (ARTICLE)
    for more information about this methodology.
