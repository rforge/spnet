Description: Facilitates the rendering of networks for which nodes have a specific position on a map (cities, participants in a political debate, etc.). Map data and network data are stored together in a single object which handles the match between network nodes and their respective position on the map. The plot method renders both the map and the network data. Several networks can be plot simultaneously. The graphic is highly customizable and the legend is automatically printed. Map data have to be supplied as SpatialPolygons objects (from the sp package) and network data as named matrix.
